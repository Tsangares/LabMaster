Calibration:
 runs for each preamp. Reads voltage and infers current from (V-V_0)/R = i

Experiment:
 Keithley set current.
 for i in pins/4:
  Arduino is used like I2C to select channel.
  Once set, Measures voltage
  Uses constants to infer current
  


Possibly make a test file actually.
Tests:
 Check to see if the variable outputs from the aglient are correct.
